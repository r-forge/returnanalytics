function (R, weightgrid, from, to)
{ # @author Brian G. Peterson

    # Description:
    # This is the workhorse of the backtest architecture.
    # Any optimization backtesting model must
    #     - create portfolios,
    #     - analyze their returns,
    #     - and allow you to use some metric, function, or algorithm
    #       to analyze the results
    #
    # function takes a set of returns, a set of portfolio weights,
    # and a timeframe to operate within, and generates a set of statistics
    # for every possible weight.
    #
    # When you calculate statistics for all possible weights generated by
    # a brute force method, an estimation method, some function,
    # a regression, etc., you can then run tests against the results "in-sample"
    # to determine which weighting vector you want to use "out-of-sample"
    # in the next rolling period.
    #
    # This function is extremely computationally intensive, because it is doing
    # a lot of things with every single possible weighting vector, so you want
    # to be able to run it and store the results for later analysis.
    # It is best to strike a balance between placing functions in here that
    # you will need to help choose the optimal weighting vector, and be
    # parsimonious, as these calculations may be run tens of thousands of times
    # in any given backtest.  Remember that once you have chosen an optimal
    # portfolio or a sub-set of possible optimal portfolios, you can run more
    # exhaustive analytics on each of your candidates later, rather than on the
    # entire set of all possible portfolios.
    #
    # R             data structure of returns
    # weightgrid    each row contains one weighting vector, same number of columns as your returns
    # from          where to cut the beginning of the return stream
    # to            where to cut the end of the return stream
    #
    # @returns      data frame where each row has the same index number as a weighting vector,
    #               and each column is one of your metrics from inside this function

    # Description:
    #
    # Performs the looping and storage of the base analytics for your series
    # of possible portfolios.  I've titled the third parameter 'yeargrid',
    # but it is really a 'rolling window grid', although these will often be years.
    # We slice the computation into these years or rolling periods,
    # and store the results separately, because each of these rolling periods will
    # have one solution for each possible weighting vector.  By generating them and
    # storing them for all weighting vecotrs in every period, you can do all the hard
    # computational work in one pass, and then reuse the data set over and over again
    # in multiple analytic tests, methods, or hypotheses for choosing in-sample results
    # to use as out-of-sample weights.
