Description: Library of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis. This library aims to aid practitioners and researchers in utilizing the latest research in analysis of non-normal return streams.  In general, this library is most tested on return (rather than price) data on a monthly scale, but most functions will work with daily or irregular return data as well.
