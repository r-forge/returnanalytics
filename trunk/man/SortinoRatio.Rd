    # Description:
    # Sortino proposed to better account for skill and excess performance
    # by using only downside semivariance as the measure of risk.

    # R     return vector
    # MAR   minimum acceptable return
    # Function:

    x = checkDataVector(R)

    result = mean (R - MAR) / DownsideDeviation(R, MAR)

    #Return:
    result
