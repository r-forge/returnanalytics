As the package "Dowd" is ported from Kevin Dowd's MATLAB Toolbox MMRII, he deserves
special acknowledgement. Without his work, this project would not have been possible.

The project started as a Google Summer of Code Project for the year 2015. So, GSoC also 
deserves acknowledgement.

Peter Carl and Brian G. Peterson who came up with this idea and mentored this project
also deserve special acknowledgement for coming up with the project idea and mentorship.
