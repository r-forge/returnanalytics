Description: Kevin Dowd's book Measuring Market Risk is a widely read book 
          in the area of risk measurement and is widely used by students and 
          practitioners alike. As he claims, MATLAB indeed might have been most 
          suitable language when Dowd originally wrote the functions, however,
          with growing popularity of R and a large user base, this project 
          should make Dowd's code accessible to more readers. As Dowd's code 
          was not intended to be error free and were more for reference, some 
          functions in this package have inherited those errors. An attempt 
          will be made in future to identify and correct them. Dowd's original 
          code can be downloaded from . It should be noted that Dowd offers both
          MMR2 and MMR1 toolboxes. Only MMR2 was ported to R. MMR2 is more 
          recent version of MMR1 toolbox and they both have mostly similar 
          function. The toolbox mainly contains different parametric and non 
	  parametric methods for measurement of market risk as well as 
	  backtesting risk measurement methods.
