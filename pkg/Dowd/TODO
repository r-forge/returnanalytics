The vignette is not yet ready for the package and it will be done in near 
future. Many examples in the source files are not insightful. They also need 
to be (and will be) changed accordingly. The dependence on forecast and few other
packages can be avoided and will be attempted in future. 

The original Dowd's package contains some errors and this package has inherited
most of them. Not all functions work perfectly. It is also a possibility that can
be explored.

There are also few functions that did not give same result as Dowd's MATLAB toolbox. 
This is possibly because of two different scenarios, either because the parameters
parameters to algorithms such as density function in Kernel Density Approach (just
for sake of example) were not suitably chosen or there actually are errors in the code.
An attempt will be made in future to remove such inconsistencies.
