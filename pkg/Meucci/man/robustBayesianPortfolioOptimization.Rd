\arguments{
  \item{mean_post}{the posterior vector of means (after
  blending prior and sample data)}

  \item{cov_post}{the posterior covariance matrix (after
  blending prior and sample data)}

  \item{nu_post}{a numeric with the relative confidence in
  the prior vs. the sample data. A value of 2 indicates
  twice as much weight to assign to the prior vs. the
  sample data. Must be greater than or equal to zero}

  \item{time_post}{a numeric}

  \item{riskAversionMu}{risk aversion coefficient for
  estimation of means.}

  \item{riskAversionSigma}{risk aversion coefficient for
  estimation of Sigma.}

  \item{discretizations}{an integer with the number of
  portfolios to generate along efficient frontier (equally
  distanced in return space). Parameter must be an integer
  greater or equal to 1.}

  \item{longonly}{a boolean for suggesting whether an asset
  in a portfolio can be shorted or not}

  \item{volatility}{a numeric with the volatility used to
  calculate gamma-m. gamma-m acts as a constraint on the
  maximum volatility of the robust portfolio. A higher
  volatility means a higher volatile robust portfolio may
  be identified.}

  equally distanced in return space. The function also
