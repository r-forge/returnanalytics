  grid}

\description{
  Grid representation by this method is an alternative to
  representing distribution of the market, such as
  importance sampling or stratified sampling.However, these
  techniques focus on sub-domains of the distribution, and
  thus, in order to apply such methods, we must forego the
  full flexibility on the specification of the views. A
  different approach, which preserves the generality of the
  views specification, consists in selecting the scenarios
  x_j deterministically as a grid and then associate with
  each of them the suitable probability p_j ( integrated
  over I_j ). The the generic interval _j contains the j-th
  point of the grid. Once the grid is defined, the entropy
  optimization can be applied to replace p_j with the new
  posterior probabilities to reflect the views. We generate
  the grid here using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature method.
