This package would not be possible without the work by Attilio Meucci not only 
to do the research, but to publish his code in an open format for others to use.

Attilio has very graciously collaborated with the R port of his code, and supported 
the work and understanding that goes with any port.  It is our hope that this 
package will be incorporated into later published versions of his work, so that
language choice is not a restricting factor in using his research for teaching or 
live portfolios.
