Xavi's notes:

* Matlab package doesn't seem to be necessary, find substitutes for its functions where possible
* There are some problems with charts and what can be done with base graphics. Maybe using ggplot2 instead of base graphics can provide more flexibility.
* All the scripts from the papers need to be revised, some don't even work.
* Maybe there are some packages that aren't needed anymore. Find out which of them. 
* Documentation for papers and functions from Ram - Manan.
* Look for the TODOs from Ram or Manan.
* Confirm every datafile is different from the others.
* Change coding style to one more R alike
* Still 2 scripts left from the book: S_MeanVarianceCallsRobust from chapter 9 and S_OptionReplication from chapter 6
* Improve documentation for every script from the book: 
	- find the exercises and sections they come from
	- write down the formulas
