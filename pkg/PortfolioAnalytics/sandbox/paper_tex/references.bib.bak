	a financial risk measure. This statistic arises in a natural way
	from the estimation of the ‘average of the 100% worst losses’
	in a sample of returns to a portfolio. Here p is some fixed confidence
	level. We also compare several alternative representations of ES
	which turn out to be more appropriate for certain purposes.},

  number = {7},
  abstract = {Expected Shortfall (ES) in several variants has been proposed as remedy
	for the defi-ciencies of Value-at-Risk (VaR) which in general is
	not a coherent risk measure. In fact, most definitions of ES lead
	to the same results when applied to continuous loss distributions.
	Differences may appear when the underlying loss distributions have
	discontinuities. In this case even the coherence property of ES can
	get lost unless one took care of the details in its definition. We
	compare some of the definitions of Expected Shortfall, pointing out
	that there is one which is robust in the sense of yielding a coherent
	risk measure regardless of the underlying distributions. Moreover,
	this Expected Shortfall can be estimated effectively even in cases
	where the usual estimators for VaR fail.

	estimation techniques is between 1.5 and 6 times lower than that
	of a value-weighted benchmark, such differences being both economically
	and statistically significant. This strongly indicates that optimal
	inclusion of hedge funds in an investor portfolio can potentially
	generate a dramatic decrease in the portfolio volatility on an out-of-sample
	basis. Differences in mean returns, on the other hand, are not statistically
	significant, suggesting that the improvement in terms of risk control
	does not necessarily come at the cost of lower expected returns.},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {Using two large hedge fund databases, this paper empirically tests
	the presence and significance of a cross-sectional relation between
	hedge fund returns and value at risk (VaR). The univariate and bivariate
	portfolio-level analyses as well as the fund-level regression results
	indicate a significantly positive relation between VaR and the cross-section
	of expected returns on live funds. During the period of January 1995
	to December 2003, the live funds with high VaR outperform those with
	low VaR by an annual return difference of 9%. This risk-return tradeoff
	holds even after controlling for age, size, and liquidity factors.
	Furthermore, the risk profile of defunct funds is found to be different
	from that of live funds. The relation between downside risk and expected
	return is found to be negative for defunct funds because taking high
	risk by these funds can wipe out fund capital, and hence they become
	defunct. Meanwhile, voluntary closure makes some well performed funds
	with large assets and low risk fall into the defunct category. Hence,
	the risk-return relation for defunct funds is more complicated than
	what implies by survival. We demonstrate how to distinguish live
	funds from defunct funds on an ex ante basis. A trading rule based
	on buying the expected to live funds and selling the expected to
	disappear funds provides an annual profit of 8–10% depending on
	the investment horizons.},

  title = {Beyond Markowitz: Building Optimal Portfolio Using Non-Elliptical

  journal = {Working paper},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {The Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) assumes that the asset return distribution
	is
	
	multivariate normal. However, statistical data show fat-tailed and
	asymmetric asset return
	
	distributions. Consequently, the minimum-variance portfolios are not
	efficient with respect
	
	to their effective risk profile (in particular, with refer to their
	tail risk). We know that only
	
	whether the asset return distribution is elliptical (for example,
	in the case of multi-normal
	
	distribution) the mean-variance criterion is correct. Hence, for non-elliptical
	distributions,
	
	the minimum-variance portfolios may be far from the efficient ones
	with respect to relevant
	
	and tractable risk measures as, in particular, the Conditional VaR
	(CVaR).
	
	The aim of this paper is therefore to underline how the optimal portfolio
	composition
	
	with respect to CVaR may change, assuming different hypotheses for
	generating the asset
	
	return scenarios. In order to achieve this purpose, primarily we generate
	scenarios for
	
	portfolio asset returns assuming the traditional hypothesis of multivariate
	conditional normal
	
	distribution. Successively, we generate the scenarios from the empirical
	distribution using
	
	Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS). Finally, we generate Monte Carlo
	(MC) asset return
	
	scenarios by using Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and copula function.
	These latter scenarios
	
	are generated from a non-elliptical multivariate distribution constructed
	by a Student’s tcopula
	
	with ten degrees of freedom and assuming marginal distributions Gaussian
	in the
	
	center and EVT distributed in the tail. Finally, we apply the whole
	methodology described to
	
	a portfolio of Italian equities.},

	a portfolio’s Valueat-
	
	Risk. Depending on both the degree of non-linearity of the instruments

	the portfolio and the willingness to make restrictive assumptions
	on the underlying
	
	statistical distributions, a variety of analytical methods and simulation-based
	methods are
	
	available. Aside from the total portfolio’s VaR, there is a growing
	need for information
	
	about (i) the marginal contribution of the individual portfolio components

	diversified portfolio VaR, (ii) the proportion of the diversified

	attributed to each of the individual components consituting the portfolio,

	incremental effect on VaR of adding a new instrument to the existing

	Expressions for these marginal, component and incremental VaR metrics

	of normally distributed returns is too stringent. Whenever these deviations

	normality are expected to cause serious distortions in VaR calculations,
	one has to resort
	
	to either alternative distribution specifications or historical and
	Monte Carlo simulation
	
	methods. Although these approaches to overall VaR estimation have
	received substantial
	
	interest in the literature, there exist to the best of our knowledge
	no procedures for
	
	estimating marginal VaR, component VaR and incremental VaR in either
	a non-normal
	
	analytical setting or a Monte Carlo / historical simulation context.
	
	This paper tries to fill this gap by investigating these VaR concepts
	in a general
	
	distribution-free setting. We derive a general expression for the
	marginal contribution of
	
	an instrument to the diversified portfolio VaR - whether this instrument
	is already
	
	included in the portfolio or not. We show how in a most general way,
	the total portfolio
	
	VaR can be decomposed in partial VaRs that can be attributed to the
	individual
	
	instruments comprised in the portfolio. These component VaRs have
	the appealing
	
	property that they aggregate linearly into the diversified portfolio
	VaR. We not only
	
	show how the standard results under normality can be generalized to
	non-normal
	
	analytical VaR approaches but also present an explicit procedure for
	estimating marginal
	
	VaRs in a simulation framework. Given the marginal VaR estimate, component
	VaR and
	
	incremental VaR readily follow. The proposed estimation approach pairs
	intuitive appeal
	
	with computational efficiency. We evaluate various alternative estimation
	methods in an
	
	application example and conclude that the proposed approach displays
	an astounding
	
	accuracy and a promising outperformance.},

	ratio, which uses the value at risk (VaR) as a risk measure, is more
	accurate than the traditional Sharpe ratio. Also, the VaR adjusted
	to the Cornish–Fisher expansion is a good compromise between the
	normal VaR (based on the standard deviation of returns) and the historical
	VaR (which uses past returns to proxy future returns). With the VaR
	adjusted to the Cornish–Fisher expansion, the paper examines the
	behaviour of a Canadian institutional investor’s portfolio which
	includes hedge funds (HFs). It is confirmed that including HFs in
	a portfolio improves its risk-adjusted performance. The findings
	are relevant for investors who invest in different traditional and
	alternative assets as well as in HFs. It should be noted, however,
	that if an investment offers a superior risk-return profile, it does
	not automatically mean that investors should buy it, as it may not
	fit their preferences and/or fit in with other available alternatives.
	
	
	Abstract: Hedge funds (HFs) are attracting growing interest from investors.
	Their persistent high returns, combined with their low correlation
	with traditional assets such as equities and bonds, have certainly
	acted in their favour. This attraction is, however, accompanied by
	a price to pay. Hedge funds’ returns generally have negative skewness
	and excess kurtosis, which force their distribution to deviate from
	normality. The purpose of this paper is to determine an acceptable
	risk measure, which allows one to analyse correctly the behaviour
	of these funds in a Canadian institutional investor portfolio. It
	is shown that the modified Sharpe ratio, which uses the value at
	risk (VaR) as a risk measure, is more accurate. Furthermore, among
	various measures of VaR, the VaR adjusted to the Cornish–Fisher
	expansion is more conservative. Overall, the paper confirms that
	including HFs in a portfolio improves its risk-adjusted performance.},

  abstract = {This Bayesian modeling book is intended for practitioners and applied
	statisticians looking for a self-contained entry to computational
	Bayesian statistics. Focusing on standard statistical models and
	backed up by discussed real datasets available from the book website,
	it provides an operational methodology for conducting Bayesian inference,
	rather than focusing on its theoretical justifications. Special attention
	is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and
	specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly,
	computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an
	effective programming of the methods given in the book. While R programs
	are provided on the book website and R hints are given in the computational
	sections of the book, The Bayesian Core requires no knowledge of
	the R language and it can be read and used with any other programming
	language.
	
	The Bayesian Core can be used as a textbook at both undergraduate
	and graduate levels, as exemplified by courses given at Universit{\'e}
	Paris Dauphine (France), University of Canterbury (New Zealand),
	and University of British Columbia (Canada). It serves as a unique
	textbook for a service course for scientists aiming at analyzing
	data the Bayesian way as well as an introductory course on Bayesian
	statistics. The prerequisites for the book are a basic knowledge
	of probability theory and of statistics. Methodological and data-based
	exercises are included within the main text and students are expected
	to solve them as they read the book. Those exercises can obviously
	serve as assignments, as was done in the above courses. Datasets,
	R codes and course slides all are available on the book website.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the risk characteristics for various hedge fund
	strategies specializing in fixed income instruments. Because fixed
	income hedge fund strategies have exceptionally high autocorrelations
	in reported returns and this is taken as evidence of return smoothing,
	we first develop a method to completely eliminate any order of autocorrelation
	process across a wide array of time series processes. Once this is
	complete, we determine the underlying risk factors to the "true"
	hedge fund returns and examine the incremental benefit attained from
	using nonlinear payoffs relative to the more traditional linear factors.
	For a great many of the hedge fund indices we find the strongest
	risk factor to be equivalent to a short put position on high-yield
	debt. In general, we find a moderate benefit to using the nonlinear
	risk factors in terms of the ability to explain reported returns.
	However, in some cases this fit is not stable even over the in-sample
	period. Finally, we examine the benefit to using various factor structures
	for estimating the value-at-risk of the hedge funds. We find, in
	general, that using nonlinear factors slightly increases the estimated
	downside risk levels of the hedge funds due to their option-like
	payoff structures.},

  journal = {Working paper},
  year = {2001},
  abstract = {Many performance measures, such as the classic Sharpe ratio have difficulty
	in evaluating the performance of mutual funds with skewed return
	distributions. Common causes for skewness are the use of options
	in the portfolio or superior market timing skills of the portfolio
	manager. In this article we examine to what extent downside risk
	and the upside potential ratio can be used to evaluate skewed return
	distributions. In order to accomplish this goal, we first show the
	relation between the risk preferences of the investor and the risk-adjusted
	performance measure. We conclude that it is difficult to interpret
	differences in the outcomes of risk-adjusted performance measures
	exclusively as differences in forecasting skills of portfolio managers.
	We illustrate this with an example of a simulation study of a protective
	put strategy. We show that the Sharpe ratio leads to incorrect conclusions
	in the case of protective put strategies. On the other hand, the
	upside potential ratio leads to correct conclusions. Finally, we
	apply downside risk and the upside potential ratio in the process
	of selecting a mutual fund from a sample of mutual funds in the Euronext
	stock markets. The rankings appear similar, which can be attributed
	to the absence of significant skewness in the sample. However, find
	that the remaining differences can be quite significant for individual
	fund managers, and that these differences can be attributed to skewness.
	Therefore, we prefer to use the UPR as an alternative to the Sharpe
	ratio, as it accounts better for the use of options and forecasting
	skills.},

	""" Although the Gibbs sampler is, formally, a special case of the
	Metropolic-Hastings algorithm (or rather a combination of Metropolis-Hastings
	algorithms applied to different components; see Theorem 10.13), the
	Gibbs sampling algorithm has a number of distinct features:
	
	+ The acceptance rate of the Gibbs sampler is uniformly equal to 1.
	Therefore, every simulated value is accepted and the suggestions
	of Section 7.6.1 on the optimal acceptance rates do not apply in
	this setting. This also means that convergence assessment for this
	algorithm should be treated differently than for Metropolis-Hastings
	techniques.
	
	+ The use of the Gibbs sampler implies limitations on the choice of
	instrumental distributions an requires a prior knowledge of some
	analytical or probabilistic properties of f.
	
	+ The Gibbs sampler is, by construction, multidimensional. Even though
	some components of the simulated vector may be artificial for the
	problem of interest, or unnecessary for the required inference, the
	construction is still at least two-dimensional.
	
	+ The Gibbs sampler does not apply to problems where the number of
	parameters varies, as in Chapter 11, because of the obvious lack
	of irreducibility of the resultung chain.

	homogeneous risk measures only derivatives yield risk contributions
	that do not exceed the corresponding stand-alone risks"(p.286).
	
	
	Tasche also says "if a risk measure is smooth, we should use its partial
	derivatives as risk contributions of the assets in the portfolio.
	Otherwise we run the risk of receiving misleading information about
	the profitability of the assets."(p.286)
	
	
	Another point he makes in the conclusion to the chapter is:
	
	
	"the allocation procedure has to be based on the derivatives of the
	applied risk measure with respect to the weights of the sub-portfolios
	or assets."(p. 299)

	on pages 284 and 285 and read most of the proof as well.},
