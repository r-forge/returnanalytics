# Introduction

- Discuss the challenges of constructing hedge fund portfolios
- Offer a framework for considering strategic allocation of hedge funds
- Discuss various methods of evaluating portfolio objectives
- Show the relative performance of multiple objectives
- Discuss extensions to the framework

# Objectives

- Identify several sets of objectives to establish benchmark and target portfolios 
- Evaluate complex constraints, including some that equalize or budget risks using downside measures of risk
- Visualize portfolio problems to build intuition about objectives and constraints
- Use analytic solvers and parallel computation as problems get more complex
<!-- 
- Rebalancing periodically and examining out of sample performance will help refine objectives
-->

# Strategic allocation
...broadly described as periodically reallocating the portfolio to achieve a long-term goal

- Understand the nature and sources of investment risk within the portfolio
- Manage the resulting balance of risk and return of the portfolio
- Apply within the context of the current economic and market situation
- Think systematically about preferences and constraints

Here we'll consider a strategic allocation to hedge funds

# Portfolio issues
Markowitz (1952) described an investor's objectives as:

* maximizing some measure of gain while
* minimizing some measure of risk

Many approaches follow Markowitz by using variance of returns for "risk"
-->

# Investor preferences...
In constructing a portfolio, most investors would prefer:

* to be approximately correct rather than precisely wrong
* the flexibility to define any kind of objective and combine the constraints
* to define risk as potential loss rather than volatility
* a framework for considering different sets of portfolio constraints for comparison through time
* to intuitively understand optimization through visualization

<!-- Comments:
Investors frequently encounter frustration with optimizers when applying them to portfolios

They want to specify objectives that are difficult to solve;
They care about losses, really and truly;
They keep adding new constraints as they think of situations they would like to avoid;
They want to easily (usually visually) compare alternatives to better understand how the rules they specify for limiting these trade-offs affect the choices being made.
-->

# ... Lead to portfolio preferences
Construct a portfolio that:

* maximizes return,
* with per-asset position limits,
* with a specific univariate portfolio risk limit,
* defines risk as losses,
* considers the effects of skewness and kurtosis, and
* either limits contribution of risk for constituents or
* equalizes component risk contribution.

<!-- Not a quadratic (or linear, or conical) problem any more. -->

# Risk budgeting
* Used to allocate the "risk" of a portfolio 
* Decomposes the total portfolio risk into the risk contribution of each component position
* Literature on risk contribution has focused on volatility rather than downside risk
* Most financial returns series seem non-normal, so we want to consider the effects of higher moments

# Return distributions
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../results/EDHEC-Distributions.png}

# Measuring risk, not volatility
Measure risk with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)

* Also called Expected Tail Loss (ETL) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
* ETL is the mean expected loss when the loss exceeds the VaR
* ETL has all the properties a risk measure should have to be coherent and is a convex function of the portfolio weights
* To account for skew and/or kurtosis, use Cornish-Fisher (or "modified") estimates of ETL instead (mETL)

# Measuring risk

# ETL sensitivity
Modified ETL demonstrates a better fit for historical CVaR at lower confidence levels, and can break down at higher confidence levels

# _Ex ante_, not _ex post_
_Ex post_ analysis of risk contribution has been around for a while

* Litterman ()

The use of _ex ante_ risk budgets is more recent

* Qian (2005): "risk parity portfolio" allocates portfolio variance equally
* Maillard _et al_ (2010): "equally-weighted risk contribution portfolio" or (ERC)
* Zhu _et al_ (2010): optimal mean-variance portfolio selection under constrained contributions

We want to look at the allocation of risk through _ex ante_ downside risk contribution

# Contribution to downside risk
Use the modified CVaR contribution estimator from Boudt, _et al_ (2008)

* CVaR contributions correspond to the conditional expectation of the return of the portfolio component when the portfolio loss is larger than its VaR loss.
* %CmETL is the ratio of the expected return on the position when the portfolio experiences a beyond-VaR loss to the expected value of the portfolio loss
* A high positive %CmETL indicates the position has a large loss when the portfolio also has a large loss

<!-- Comments:
Enabled through the Euler decomposition 
-->

# Contribution to downside risk
* The higher the percentage mETL, the more the portfolio downside risk is concentrated on that asset
* Allows us to directly optimize downside risk diversification
* Lends itself to a simple algorithm that computes both CVaR and component CVaR in less than a second, even for large portfolios

We can use CVaR contributions as an objective or constraint in portfolio optimization

# Two strategies for using downside contribution in allocation
## Equalize downside risk contribution

* Define downside risk diversification as an objective

## Downside risk budget

* Impose bound constraints on the percentage mETL contributions

# Start with some general constraints
Constraints specified for each asset in the portfolio:

* Maximum position: 30%
* Minimum position: 5%
* Weights sum to 100%
* Group constraints
* Rebalancing quarterly

# Estimate
One of the largest challenges in optimization is improving the estimates of the moments

* Optimizer chooses portfolios based on forward looking estimates of risk and return based on the constituent moments
* Usually explicitly making trade-offs between correlation and volatility among members 
* Modified ETL extends the tradeoffs to the first four moments and co-moments
* Historical sample moments are used here as predictors 

<!-- Comments:
Historical sample moments work fine in in normal market regimes, but poorly when the market regime shifts
For the purposes of this presentation, we're going to ignore this very important topic.
*** We should discuss using some form of improved but standard method here as to not be completely stupid ***

# Define multiple objectives

Equal contribution to:

* weight
* variance
* risk
  
Reward to risk:

* mean-variance
* mean-modified ETL

Minimum:

* variance
* modified ETL

<!--Comments:
# Equal contribution...
...to Weight

* Implies diversification but has nothing to say about returns or risk

...to Variance

* Allocates portfolio variance equally across the portfolio components

...to Risk

* Use (percentage) ETL contributions to directly diversify downside risk among components
* Actually the minimum concentration component risk contribution portfolio

# Reward to risk ratios...
...mean/variance

* A traditional reward to risk objective that penalizes upside volatility as risk

...mean/modified ETL

* A reward-to-downside-risk objective that uses higher moments to estimate the tail

# Minimum...
...variance

* The portfolio with the forecasted variance of return

...ETL

* The portfolio with the minimum forecasted ETL

Minimum risk portfolios generally suffer from the drawback of portfolio concentration.
-->
<!-- Only two of these deserve more discussion -->

# Equal-weight portfolio

* Provides a benchmark to evaluate the performance of an optimized portfolio against
* Each asset in the portfolio is purchased in the same quantity at the beginning of the period
* The portfolio is rebalanced back to equal weight at the beginning of the next period
* Implies no information about return or risk
* Is the re-weighting adding or subtracting value?
* Do we have a useful view of return and risk?

# Contribution of Risk in Equal Weight Portfolio
insert table

# Equal Contribution to Risk
The risk parity constraint that requires all assets to contribute to risk equally is usually too restrictive.

* Use the Minimum Concentration Component (MCC) risk contribution portfolio as an objective
* Minimize the largest ETL risk contribution in the portfolio
* Unconstrained, the MCC generates similar portfolios to the risk parity portfolio
* The MCC can, however, be more easily be combined with other objectives and constraints

<!--- Insert more on the methodology for equal contribution to ETL -->

# Constrained Risk Contribution
Risk Budget as an eighth objective set

* Drop the position constraints altogether
* No non-directional constituent may contribute more than 40% to portfolio risk
* No directional constituent may contribute more than 30% to portfolio risk, except for...
* ... Distressed, which cannot contribute more than 15% 
* Directional, as a group, may not contribute more than 60% of the risk to the portfolio

<!-- Comments:
Starts to sound more like a policy

<!--- METHODS -->

# Optimizers
## Closed-form

* Linear programming (LP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
* Quadratic programming

## General Purpose Continuous Solvers

* Random portfolios
* Differential evolution
* Partical swarm 
* Simulated annealing

<!-- Comments:
Such functions are very compute intensive - so linear, quadradic or conical objectives are better addressed through closed-form optimizers.  However, many business objectives do not fall into those categories, and brute force solutions are often intractable
-->

# Random Portfolios
It is what it sounds like

* From a portfolio seed, generate random permutations of weights that meet your constraints 
* Several methods: [Burns (2009)](http://www.portfolioprobe.com/blog/), Shaw (2010), and Gilli, _et al_ (2011)

Sampling can help provide insight into the goals and constraints of the optimization

* Covers the 'edge case' (min/max) constraints well
* Covers the 'interior' portfolios
* Useful for finding the search space for an optimizer
* Allows arbitrary number of samples
* Allows massively parallel execution

<!-- Comments:
The 'sample' method to generate random portfolios is based on an idea by Pat Burns. This is the most flexible method, but also the slowest, and can generate portfolios to satisfy leverage, box, group, and position limit constraints.  *** What about Portfolio attribute constraints? Should ***

The 'simplex' method to generate random portfolios is based on a paper by W. T. Shaw. The simplex method is useful to generate random portfolios with the full investment constraint, where the sum of the weights is equal to 1, and min box constraints. Many other constraints such as the box constraint max, group and position limit constraints will be handled by elimination. 

The 'grid' method to generate random portfolios is based on the gridSearch function in package NMOF. The grid search method only satisfies the min and max box constraints.

# Differential Evolution
All numerical optimizations are a tradeoff between speed and accuracy

Differential evolution will get more directed with each generation, rather than the uniform search of random portfolios

Allows more logical 'space' to be searched with the same number of trial portfolios for more complex objectives

doesn't test many portfolios on the interior of the portfolio space

Early generations search a wider space; later generations increasingly focus on the space that is near-optimal

Random jumps are performed in every generation to avoid local minima
