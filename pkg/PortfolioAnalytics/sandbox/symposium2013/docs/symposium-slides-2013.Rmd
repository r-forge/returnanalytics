To create PDF of slides:
$ pandoc slides.Rmd -t beamer -o slides.pdf

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).  Or see: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

# Introduction

- Discuss the challenges of constructing hedge fund portfolios
- Offer a framework for considering strategic allocation of dynamic strategies
- Show the relative performance of multiple objectives
- Discuss extensions to the framework

# Objectives

- Visualization can help you build intuition about your objectives and constraints
- Rebalancing periodically and examining out of sample performance will help refine objectives
- Analytic solvers and parallel computation are valuable as problems get more complex

# Process
Insert process diagram here? Optional

# Strategic allocation
...broadly described as periodically reallocating the portfolio to achieve a long-term goal

- Understanding the nature and sources of investment risk within the portfolio
- Manage the resulting balance of risk and return of the portfolio
- Apply within the cotext of the current economic and market situation
- Think systematically about preferences and constraints

Alternative 1: Use hedge fund styles

Relative Value
* Fixed Income Arb
* Convertible Arb
* Equity Market Neutral
* Event Driven

Directional
* Equity Long/Short
* Macro
* CTA

Alternative 2: Use existing rule-based strategies

Basically 4 broad categories of strategy:
- Momentum
- Carry
- Value
- Volatility

Across major asset classes:
- Equities
- Fixed Income
- Commodities
- FX

Rules-based strategies designed to operate within a pre-defined set of rules and procedures. eliminates concerns about style drift and other issues about how various strategies perform in different states of the world. All of this data is available via Bloomberg (tickers are listed):
Momentum - Equity - AIJPMEUU (USD)
Momentum - FX - AIJPMF1U (USD)
Momentum - Commodity (Energy) - AIJPMCEU (USD) - Morningstar instead?
Momentum - Fixed Income (short dated) - AIJPMMUU
Carry - FX (G10)- AIJPCF1U
Carry - Fixed Income (2yr) - AIJPCB1U
Carry - Commodity - AIJPCC1U
Carry - All - GCSCS2UE
Volatility - Equity (Imp vs. Realized) - AIJPSV1U
Volatility - FX - CSVILEUS (long only)
Volatility - Equities (CS RVIX) - CSEARVIX
Value - Emerging Markets (bonds) - EMFXSEUS
Value - Equities (CS HOLT RAII) - RAIIHRVU
Value - Commodities (CS GAINS) - CSGADLSE

Alternative 3: Create rule based strategies
Use continuous series for commodities contracts and construct trend and counter trend strategies.  More limited sources of edge than in the prior alternative, but more leveragable work.  Could add hedging pressure as a third example.

# Portfolio issues
Markowitz (1952) described an investor's objectives as:

* maximizing some measure of gain while
* minimizing some measure of risk

Many approaches follow Markowitz by using mean return and standard devation of returns for "risk"

# Portfolio issues
Most investors would prefer:

* to be approximately correct rather than precisely wrong
* to define risk as potential loss rather than volatility
* the flexibility to define any kind of objective and combine the constraints
* a framework for considering different sets of portfolio constraints for comparison through time
* to intuitively understand optimization through visualization

# Portfolio issues
Construct a portfolio that:

* maximizes return,
* with per-asset conditional constraints,
* with a specific univariate risk limit,
* while minimizing component risk concentration,
* and limiting drawdowns to a threshhold value.

Not a quadratic (or linear, or conical) problem any more.

# Risk rather than volatility

* Expected Tail Loss (ETL) is also called Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
* ETL is the mean expected loss when the loss exceeds the VaR
* ETL has all the properties a risk measure should have to be coherent and is a convex function of the portfolio weights
* Returns are skewed and/or kurtotic, so we use Cornish-Fisher (or "modified") estimates of ETL instead

# Use Random Portfolios
[Burns (2009)](http://www.portfolioprobe.com/blog/) describes Random Portfolios

* From a portfolio seed, generate random pemutations of weights that meet your constraints on each asset
* add more here

Sampling can help provide insight into the goals and constraints of the optimization

* Covers the 'edge case' (min/max) constraints well
* Covers the 'interior' portfolios
* Useful for finding the search space for an optimizer
* Allows arbitrary number o fsamples
* Allows massively parallel execution

# Add general constraints
Constraints specified for each asset in the portfolio:

* Maximum position:
* Minimum position:
* Weights sum to 100%
* Weights step size of 0.5%

Other settings:

* Confidence for VaR/ETL set at
* Random portfolios with X000 permutations
* Rebalancing quarterly (or monthly?)

# Estimation

* Optimizer chooses portfolios based on forward looking estimates of risk and return based on the portfolio moments
* Estimates use the first four moments and co-moments
* Historical sample moments work fine as predictors in normal market regimes, but poorly when the market regime shifts

One of the largest challenges in optimization is improving the estimates of return and volatility

# Forecasting
## Returns

## Volatility


# Forecasting correlation

# Equal-weight portfolio

* Provides a benchmark to evaluate the performance of an optimized portfolio against
* Each asset in the portfolio is purchased in the same quantity at the beginning of the period
* The portfolio is rebalanced back to equal weight at the beginning of the next period
* Implies no information about return or risk
* Is the re-weighting adding or subtracting value?
* Do we have a useful view of return and risk?

# Sampled portfolios

# Turnover from equal-weight

# Multiple objectives

Equal contribution to:

* weight
* variance
* risk
  
Reward to risk:

* mean-variance
* mean-modified ETL

Minimum:

* variance
* modified ETL

# Equal contribution...
...to Weight

* Implies diversification but has nothing to say about returns or risk

...to Variance

* Allocates portfolio variance equally across the portfolio components

...to Risk

* Use (percentage) ETL contributions to directly diversify downside risk among components
* Actually the minimum component risk contribution concentration portfolio

# Reward to risk ratios...
...mean/variance

* A traditional reward to risk objective that penalizes upside volatility as risk

...mean/modified ETL

* A reward-to-downside-risk objective that uses higher moments to estimate the tail

# Minimum...
...variance

* The portfolio with the forecasted variance of return

...ETL

* The portfolio with the minimum forecasted ETL

Minimum risk portfolios generally suffer from the drawback of portfolio concentration.

# Conclusions
As a framework for strategic allocation:

* Random Portfolios can help you build intuition about your objectives and constraints
* Rebalancing periodically and examining out of sample performance can help you refine objectives
* Differential Optimization and parallelization are valuable as objectives get more complicated
