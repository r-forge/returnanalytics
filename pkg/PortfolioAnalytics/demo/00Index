constrained_optim	Demonstrate creating and using constrained portfolio optimization using the dataset 'edhec'.  Includes examples of both DEoptim and random portfolio optimization.
sortino             Maximize the Sortino Ratio of the portfolio 
testing_ROI  Demonstrate creating constraint object and solve five basic convex portfolio optimization problems with ROI using the 'edhec' dataset.
testing_pso  Demonstrate creating constraint object and solve portfolio optimization problems with pso using the 'edhec' dataset.  These sample problems are similar to those used in testing_ROI, so that one can compare solutions easily.
testing_GenSA  Demonstrate the creating constraint object and solve portfolio optimization problems with GenSA using the 'edhec' datset.  These sample problems are similar to those used in testing_ROI, so that one can compare solutions easily.
