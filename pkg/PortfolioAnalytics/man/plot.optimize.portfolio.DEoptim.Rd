\code{neighbors} may be specified in three ways.  
The first is as a single number of neighbors.  This will extract the \code{neighbors} closest 
portfolios in terms of the \code{out} numerical statistic.
The second method consists of a numeric vector for \code{neighbors}.
This will extract the \code{neighbors} with portfolio index numbers that correspond to the vector contents.
The third method for specifying \code{neighbors} is to pass in a matrix.  
This matrix should look like the output of \code{\link{extractStats}}, and should contain
\code{risk.col},\code{return.col}, and weights columns all properly named.}
