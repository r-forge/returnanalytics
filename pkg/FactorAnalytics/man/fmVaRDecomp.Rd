\usage{
fmVaRDecomp(object, ...)

\method{fmVaRDecomp}{tsfm}(object, p = 0.95, method = c("modified",
  "gaussian", "historical", "kernel"), invert = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{fit object of class \code{tsfm}, \code{sfm} or \code{ffm}.}

\item{p}{confidence level for calculation. Default is 0.95.}

\item{method}{method for computing VaR, one of "modified","gaussian",
"historical", "kernel". Default is "modified". See details.}

\item{invert}{logical; whether to invert the VaR measure. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{other optional arguments passed to
\code{\link[PerformanceAnalytics]{VaR}}.}
}
\value{
A list containing
\item{VaR.fm}{length-N vector of factor model VaRs of N-asset returns.}
\item{n.exceed}{length-N vector of number of observations beyond VaR for
each asset.}
\item{idx.exceed}{list of numeric vector of index values of exceedances.}
\item{mVaR}{N x (K+1) matrix of marginal contributions to VaR.}
\item{cVaR}{N x (K+1) matrix of component contributions to VaR.}
\item{pcVaR}{N x (K+1) matrix of percentage component contributions to VaR.}
Where, \code{K} is the number of factors and N is the number of assets.

\description{
Compute the factor contributions to Value-at-Risk (VaR) of
assets' returns based on Euler's theorem, given the fitted factor model.
The partial derivative of VaR wrt factor beta is computed as the expected
factor return given fund return is equal to its VaR and approximated by a
kernel estimator. VaR is computed either as the sample quantile or as an
estimated quantile using the Cornish-Fisher expansion.
}
\details{
The factor model for an asset's return at time \code{t} has the
form \cr \cr \code{R(t) = beta'F(t) + e(t) = beta.star'F.star(t)} \cr \cr
where, \code{beta.star=(beta,sig.e)} and \code{F.star(t)=[F(t)',z(t)]'}. By
Euler's theorem, the VaR of the asset's return is given by:
\cr \cr \code{VaR.fm = sum(cVaR_k) = sum(beta.star_k*mVaR_k)} \cr \cr
where, summation is across the \code{K} factors and the residual,
\code{cVaR} and \code{mVaR} are the component and marginal
contributions to \code{VaR} respectively. The marginal contribution to VaR
is defined as the expectation of \code{F.star}, conditional on the loss
being equal to \code{VaR.fm}. This is approximated as described in
Epperlein & Smillie (2006); a triangular smoothing kernel is used here.

Computation of the risk measure is done using
\code{\link[PerformanceAnalytics]{VaR}}. Arguments \code{p}, \code{method}
and \code{invert} are passed to this function. Refer to their help file for
details and other options.
