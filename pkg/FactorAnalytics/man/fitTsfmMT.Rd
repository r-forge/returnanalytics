\title{Fit a market timing time series factor model}
\usage{
fitTsfmMT(asset.names, mkt.name, rf.name = NULL, data = data,
  fit.method = c("LS", "DLS", "Robust"), control = fitTsfm.control(...),
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{asset.names}{vector containing names of assets, whose returns or 
excess returns are the dependent variable.}

\item{mkt.name}{name of the column for market returns (required).}

\item{rf.name}{name of the column of risk free rate variable to calculate 
excess returns for all assets (in \code{asset.names}) and the market factor 
(in \code{mkt.name}). Default is NULL, and no action is taken.}

\item{data}{vector, matrix, data.frame, xts, timeSeries or zoo object
containing column(s) named in \code{asset.names}, \code{factor.names} and 
optionally, \code{mkt.name} and \code{rf.name}.}

\item{fit.method}{the estimation method, one of "LS", "DLS" or "Robust". 
See details. Default is "LS".}

\item{control}{list of control parameters passed to \code{\link{fitTsfm}}. 
Refer to \code{\link{fitTsfm.control}} for details.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link{fitTsfm.control}}}
}
\value{
Similar to \code{fitTsfm}, \code{fitTsfmMT} also returns an object 
of class \code{"tsfm"}, for which \code{print}, \code{plot}, \code{predict} 
and \code{summary} methods exist. The generic accessor functions \code{coef}, 
\code{fitted}, \code{residuals} and \code{fmCov} can be applied as well.

An object of class \code{"tsfm"} is a list containing the following 
components:
\item{asset.fit}{list of fitted objects for each asset. Each object is of 
class \code{lm} if \code{fit.method="LS" or "DLS"}, class \code{lmRob} if 
the \code{fit.method="Robust"}.}
\item{alpha}{length-N vector of estimated alphas.}
\item{beta}{N x 2 matrix of estimated betas.}
\item{r2}{length-N vector of R-squared values.}
\item{resid.sd}{length-N vector of residual standard deviations.}
\item{call}{the matched function call.}
\item{data}{xts data object containing the asset(s) and factor(s) returns.}
\item{asset.names}{asset.names as input.}
\item{factor.names}{vector containing the names of the market-timing factor 
and the market factor}
\item{mkt.name}{mkt.name as input}
\item{fit.method}{fit.method as input.}
Where N is the number of assets and T is the number of time periods.

\description{
This is a wrapper function to fit a market timing time series 
factor model for one or more asset returns or excess returns using time 
series regression. Users can choose between ordinary least squares-LS, 
discounted least squares-DLS (or) robust regression. An object of class 
\code{"tsfm"} is returned.
}
\details{
Market timing accounts for the price movement of the general stock market 
relative to fixed income securities. A market-timing factor is added to the 
time series regression, following Henriksson & Merton (1981). Here, we use 
down.market = max(0, R_f-R_m), where Rm is the (excess) return on the market. 
The coefficient of this down-market factor can be interpreted as the number 
of "free" put options on the market provided by the manager's market-timings 
skills.

\examples{
# load data from the database
data(managers)

# example: Market-timing time series factor model with LS fit
fit <- fitTsfmMT(asset.names=colnames(managers[,(1:6)]), mkt.name="SP500.TR",
                 rf.name="US.3m.TR", data=managers)
summary(fit)
