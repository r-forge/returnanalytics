Description: An R package for the estimation and risk analysis of linear factor
    models for asset returns and portfolios. It contains model fitting methods
    for the three major types of factor models: time series (or, macroeconomic)
    factor model, fundamental factor model and statistical factor model. They
    allow for different types of distributions to be specified for modeling the
    fat-tailed behavior of financial returns, including Edgeworth expansions.
    Risk analysis measures such as VaR and ES, as well as performance 
    attribution for factor models (factor-contributed vs idiosyncratic returns) 
    are included.
