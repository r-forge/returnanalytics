EntropyProg.R,EntropyProg,,EntropyProg.R,This is the core entropy pooling engine required many of the Meucci scripts. Other scripts require this function loaded in memory to work propertly. The entropy pooling program blends views on scenarios with a prior scenario-probability distribution. The script is heavily commented so the reader can see how the concepts in the paper connect to the procedures. I performed a good deal of testing on alternative optimization routines using the NLOPTR library for the constrained and unconstrained optimization. The methods I selected were fastest in most trials however it's possible other routines are superior.,Primary,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,

MeucciCmaCopula.R,MvnRnd,http://www.symmys.com/node/162,MvnRnd.m,A common function that ensures sampled moments match population moments. This function is used in several of Meucci scripts. I am using a workaround and this is not implemented correctly as it requires a matrix package that returns the Unitary matrix from a Schur decomposition to complete properly.,Auxiliary but can be used as a primary function in other contexts,Yes,,,,Use Schur decomposition to solve Riccati equation and implement this properly. Need a function in R that returns the unitary matrix from a Schur decomposition. Right now function is only sampling from mvrnorm so sample moments do no match population moments. The overall CMA Copula script will work fine using the current implementation and number of draws can be increased so sample moments converge to population moments.

MeucciRankingInformation.R,ViewRankingTest,Entropy Pooling / Ranking Information,ViewRanking.m,"A generic function to create views with ranking information. I was creating this function so it could be used for general purposes rather than the specific purposes of Meucci's paper. Some consideration needs to be given to how multiple types of view constraints interact (i.e. a ranking view, a view on expectations, a view on correlation). The idea views can be stacked in the equality and inequality matrices and then the entropy program can be called to generate the posterior probabilities. This was my general plan of attack as the extant Meucci functions do not offer this capabilitiy (instead they focus one one-off views). This set of generic functions is a work in progress.",Primary,No,No,No,No,
