\description{
  True returns represent the flow of information that would
  determine the equilibrium value of the fund's securities
  in a frictionless market. However, true economic returns
  are not observed. The returns to hedge funds and other
  alternative investments are often highly serially
  correlated.We propose an econometric model of return
  smoothingand develop estimators for the smoothing proÔ¨Åle
  as well as a smoothing-adjusted Sharpe ratio.
}
\details{
  To quantify the impact of all of these possible sources
  of serial correlation, denote by R(t) the true economic
  return of a hedge fund in period 't'; and let R(t)
  satisfy the following linear single-factor model: where:
  \deqn{R(0,t) = \theta_{0}R(t) + \theta_{1}R(t-1) +
  \theta_{2}R(t-2) ....  + \theta_{k}R(t-k)} where
  \eqn{\theta}'i is defined as the weighted lag of
  autocorrelated lag and whose sum is 1.
