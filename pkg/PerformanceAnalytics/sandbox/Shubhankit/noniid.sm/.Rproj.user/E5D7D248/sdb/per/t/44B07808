The details of model\n  specification are given under ‘Details’.}\n\n  \\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment\n  (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame)\n  containing the variables in the model. If not found in\n  data, the variables are taken from environment(formula),\n  typically the environment from which lm is called.}\n\n  \\item{vcov}{HC-HAC covariance estimation}\n\n  \\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights to be used\n  in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric\n  vector. If non-NULL, weighted least squares is used with\n  weights weights (that is, minimizing sum(w*e^2));\n  otherwise ordinary least squares is used. See also\n  ‘Details’,}\n\n  \\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of\n  observations to be used in the fitting process.}\n\n  \\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should\n  happen when the data contain NAs. The default is set by\n  the na.action setting of options, and is na.fail if that\n  is unset. The ‘factory-fresh’ default is na.omit.\n  Another possible value is NULL, no action. Value\n  na.exclude can be useful.}\n\n  \\item{method}{the method to be used; for fitting,\n  currently only method = \"qr\" is supported; method =\n  \"model.frame\" returns the model frame (the same as with\n  model = TRUE, see below).}\n\n  \\item{model}{logicals. If TRUE the corresponding\n  components of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix,\n  the response, the QR decomposition) are returned.}\n\n  \\item{x}{logicals. If TRUE the corresponding components\n  of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the\n  response, the QR decomposition) are returned.}\n\n  \\item{y}{logicals. If TRUE the corresponding components\n  of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the\n  response, the QR decomposition) are returned.}\n\n  \\item{qr}{logicals. If TRUE the corresponding components\n  of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the\n  response, the QR decomposition) are returned.}\n\n  \\item{singular.ok}{logical. If FALSE (the default in S\n  but not in R) a singular fit is an error.}\n\n  \\item{contrasts}{an optional list. See the contrasts.arg\n  of model.matrix.default.}\n\n  \\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an a priori\n  known component to be included in the linear predictor\n  during fitting. This should be NULL or a numeric vector\n  of length equal to the number of cases. One or more\n  offset terms can be included in the formula instead or as\n  well, and if more than one are specified their sum is\n  used. See model.offset.}\n\n  \\item{\\dots}{additional arguments to be passed to the low\n  level regression fitting functions (see below).}\n}\n\\description{\n  lm is used to fit generalized linear models, specified by\n  giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor and\n  a description of the error distribution.\n}\n\\details{\n  see \\code{\\link{lm}}.\n}\n\\author{\n  The original R implementation of glm was written by Simon\n  Davies working for Ross Ihaka at the University of\n  Auckland, but has since been extensively re-written by\n  members of the R Core team. The design was inspired by\n  the S function of the same name described in Hastie &\n  Pregibon (1992).\n}\n\\keyword{covariance}\n\\keyword{estimation}\n\\keyword{fitting}\n\\keyword{HAC}\n\\keyword{HC}\n\\keyword{model}\n\\keyword{regression}\n\n",
