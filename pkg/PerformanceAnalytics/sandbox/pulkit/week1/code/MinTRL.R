#'@title Minimum Track Record Length
#'
#'@description
#'Minimum Track Record Length will tell us â€œHow long should a track record be in 
#'order to have statistical confidence that its Sharpe ratio is above a given 
#'threshold? ". If a track record is shorter than MinTRL, we do not have enough
#'confidence that the observed Sharpe Ratio is above the designated threshold.
#'The reference Sharpe Ratio should be less than the observed Sharpe Ratio and 
#'the Values should be given in non-annualized terms, in the same periodicity as
#'the return series. The Minimum Track Record Length is also given in the same 
#'Periodicity as the Return Series.
#'
#'\deqn{MinTRL = n^\ast = 1+\biggl[1-\hat{\gamma_3}\hat{SR}+\frac{\hat{\gamma_4}}{4}\hat{SR^2}\biggr]\biggl(\frac{Z_\alpha}{\hat{SR}-SR^\ast}\biggr)^2}
#'
#'$\gamma{_3}$ and $\gamma{_4}$ are the skewness and kurtosis respectively. 
#'It is important to note that MinTRL is expressed in terms of number of observations,
#'not annual or calendar terms.
