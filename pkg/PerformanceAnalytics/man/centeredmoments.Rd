\title{ calculate centered Returns }
\description{
the \eqn{n}-th centered moment is calculated as
\deqn{
 \mu^{(n)}(R) = E\lbrack(R-E(R))^n\rbrack
}{moment^n(R) = E[R-E(R)^n]}

These functions are used internally by PerformanceAnalytics to calculate centered moments for a multivariate distribution as well as the standardized moments of a portfolio distribution.  They are exposed here for users who wish to use them directly, and we'll get more documentation written when we can.
}
\usage{
centeredcomoment (Ra, Rb, p1, p2, normalize = FALSE)
centeredmoment (R, power)
Return.centered (R, ...)
% Ipower (power, h)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{R}{ an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of asset returns }
  \item{Ra}{ an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of asset returns }
  \item{Rb}{ an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of index, benchmark, portfolio, or secondary asset returns to compare against }
  \item{power}{ power or moment to calculate }
  \item{p1}{ first power of the comoment }
  \item{p2}{ second power of the comoment }
%  \item{h}{ ~~Describe \code{h} here~~ }
  \item{normalize}{ whether to standardize the calculation to agree with common usage, or leave the default mathematical meaning }
  \item{\dots}{ any other passthru parameters }
}
\details{
These functions were first utilized in Boudt, Peterson, and Croux (2008), and have been subsequently used in our other research.

  ~~ Additional Details will be added to documentation as soon as we have time to write them. Documentation Patches Welcome. ~~
