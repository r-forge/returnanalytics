Description: Collection of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis. This package aims to aid practitioners and researchers in utilizing the latest research in analysis of non-normal return streams.  In general, it is most tested on return (rather than price) data on a regular scale, but most functions will work with irregular return data as well, and increasing numbers of functions will work with P&L or price data where possible.
Depends: R (>= 2.9.0), zoo, xts (>= 0.7)
Suggests: Hmisc, MASS, tseries, quadprog, sn, robustbase, quantreg, SparseM
