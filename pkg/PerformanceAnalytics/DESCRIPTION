Description: Collection of econometric functions for
    performance and risk analysis. This package aims to aid
    practitioners and researchers in utilizing the latest
    research in analysis of non-normal return streams.  In
    general, it is most tested on return (rather than
    price) data on a regular scale, but most functions will
    work with irregular return data as well, and increasing
    numbers of functions will work with P&L or price data
    where possible.
