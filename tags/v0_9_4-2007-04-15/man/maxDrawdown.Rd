\title{ caclulate the maximum drawdown from peak equity }
\description{
To find the maximum drawdown in a return series, we need to first calculate the cumulative returns and the maximum cumulative return to that point.  Any time the cumulative returns dips below the maximum cumulative returns, it's a drawdown.  Drawdowns are measured as a percentage of that maximum cumulative return, in effect, measured from peak equity.
